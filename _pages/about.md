I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/cj-crim/) at Sam Houston State University. Broadly, my work theorizes about the institutional dynamics of contested fields. As a trained sociologist, I take a mixed-methods approach to studying gray markets, the motivations for politically motivated violence, and more recently, the commodification of the prison experience.  

My research on these topics has been previously been published in *Social Problems*, *Crime & Delinquency*, *Poetics*, *Law & Policy*, *Sociological Inquiry*, *Sociological Perspectives*, and *Sociological Focus*. Recently, my article "“Cannabis Businesses Are Being Good Contributors to the Community”: The Regulated Cannabis Industry and Cannabis Normalization in the United States" was accepted for publication in [Crime & Delinquency](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00111287231193989). Please [email me](abk017@shsu.edu) if you would like preprint access.

I earned my B.A. in Letters, Arts, and Sciences from Penn State-Altoona and my M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Arizona.
