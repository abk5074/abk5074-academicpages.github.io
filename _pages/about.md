I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/cj-crim/) at Sam Houston State University. Broadly, my work theorizes the institutional dynamics of contested fields. As a trained sociologist, I take a mixed-methods approach to studying gray markets, political violence, and more recently, the commodification of the prison experience.  

My research has been published in *Social Problems*, *Crime & Delinquency*, *Poetics*, *Law & Policy*, *Sociological Inquiry*, *Sociological Perspectives*, and *Sociological Focus*. My most recent article "Becoming a Cannabis Professional" was accepted at [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1475682x). Please [email me](abk017@shsu.edu) if you would like preprint access.

I earned my B.A. in Letters, Arts, and Sciences from Penn State-Altoona and my M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Arizona.
