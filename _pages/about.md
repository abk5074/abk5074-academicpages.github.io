I am a mixed methods sociologist focused on theory generating studies of institutional change in gray markets situated between the boundaries of law. I work at the intersections of economic sociology, criminological theory, and political-cultural approaches to market behavior to explore how micro-level social processes influence field-level structural change. My current work is exploring how the current regulatory climate is configuring the U.S. cannabis industry. My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314) and is forthcoming in [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/usfo20/current).
