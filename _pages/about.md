I am a mixed-methods sociologist focusing on theory generating studies of institutional change in gray markets situated between the boundaries of law. I work at the intersections of economic sociology, organizational theory, and political-cultural approaches to deviant behavior to explore how micro-level social processes influence field-level structural change. My current work is exploring how the current regulatory climate is configuring the U.S. cannabis industry by influencing the emergence of "provisional" institutions meant to act as temporary solutions to business problems in the absence of clear institutional guidance. My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001).
