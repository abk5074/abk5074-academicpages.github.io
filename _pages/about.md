I am a mixed methods sociologist focused on theory generating studies of institutional change. Broadly, I work at the intersections of organizational theory, economic sociology, criminology and sociolegal studies to explore how micro-level behavior influences the emergence of structure in unsettled fields. Specifically, I focus on how individuals and organizations shape the trajectory of semi-legal markets. My current research centers on commercial cannabis in the United States in order to understand how cannabis professionals are shaping the future of the market through strategies and practices to manage conflicting regulations. 

In addition to this project, I maintain an active research agenda exploring the diffusion of human rights discourse through international peace treaties and the structural outcomes of civil conficts.   

My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314) and is forthcoming in [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/usfo20/current).
