I am a mixed methods sociologist focused on theory generating studies of institutional change. Broadly, I work at the theoretical intersection of crime, law, and society, organizational theory, and economic sociology to explore how micro-level behavior translates into the emergence of structure in unsettled fields. Specifically, I focus on how individuals and organizations shape the trajectory of semi-legal markets. My current research centers on how semi-legality becomes a source of professional power and constraint within the U.S. commercial cannabis industry. 

In addition to this project, I maintain an active research agenda exploring the diffusion of human rights discourse through international peace treaties and the structural outcomes of civil conficts.   

My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314) and is forthcoming in [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/usfo20/current).
