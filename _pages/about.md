I am a mixed methods sociologist focused on studies of institutional change. Broadly, I work at the theoretical intersection of crime, law, and society, organizational theory, and economic sociology to explore the emergence of structure in unsettled fields. Specifically, I focus on how different types of actors shape the trajectory of semi-legal markets. My current research centers on how semi-legality acts as a source of professional power and social control within the U.S. commercial cannabis industry. 

In addition to this project, I maintain an active research agenda exploring the dynamics of politically motivated violence using various approaches to automated text analysis.   

My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314), [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soin.12409), and [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2020.1845260).
