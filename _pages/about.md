I am a sociologist that utilizes mixed methods to study deviant markets and the dynamics of politically motivated violence. Broadly, I work at the theoretical intersection of criminology, organizational theory, and economic sociology. Specifically, I have two current research programs: 1. Studying how semi-legality is a professional asset and liability for commercial cannabis businesses in the United States, and 2. Utilizing innovative commputational text analysis techniques to study the motivations for, and consequences of, terrorism, mass shootings, and human rights violations. My dissertation research analyzes the conflict between state laws legalizing cannabis and federal precedent criminalizing cannabis, to explore how different mechanisms of social control are implemented in the U.S. cannabis market that open up avenues for cannabis businesses to influence specific types of policy changes.

Additionally, I work as a Research and Evaluation Specialist at the Pima County Superior Court. In this capacity, I work as a program evaluator to support the Safety & Justice Challenge and Probation Drug Court expansion projects. This is a MacArthur Foundation funded position to evaluate the efficacy of pre-indictment diversion programs that are partnering with mental health and transitional housing service providers to reduce the incarceration rate of non-violent drug offenders in the greater Tucson area.

My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314), [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soin.12409), and [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2020.1845260).
