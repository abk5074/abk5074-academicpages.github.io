I am a sociologist that uses mixed methods to study gray markets, the commodification of the prison, and the dynamics of politically motivated violence. Broadly, I work at the theoretical intersection of crime, law, and deviance, economic sociology, and organizational institutionalism. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/cj-crim/) at Sam Houston State University. My most recent article "“Cannabis Businesses Are Being Good Contributors to the Community”: The Regulated Cannabis Industry and Cannabis Normalization in the United States" has been published online in [Crime & Delinquency](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00111287231193989). Please email me if you would like preprint access.
