I am a sociologist that utilizes mixed methods to study deviant markets and the dynamics of politically motivated violence. Broadly, I work at the theoretical intersection of criminology, organizational theory, and economic sociology. Specifically, I have two current research programs: 1. Studying how semi-legality is a professional asset and liability for commercial cannabis businesses in the United States, and 2. Utilizing innovative computational text analysis techniques to study the motivations for, and consequences of, terrorism, mass shootings, and human rights violations. My dissertation research analyzes how the conflict between state and federal laws concerning the legality of cannabis informs broader mechanisms of social control in the U.S. cannabis market and opens up avenues for cannabis businesses to shape the trajectory of cannabis policies.

Additionally, I work as a Research & Evaluation Specialist at the Pima County Superior Court. In this capacity, I conduct process and outcome evaluations of Safety & Justice Challenge and Probation Drug Court expansion projects. This is a MacArthur Foundation funded position that is focused on evaluating the efficacy of pre-indictment diversion programs that are partnering with mental health and transitional housing service providers to reduce the incarceration rate of non-violent drug offenders in the greater Tucson area. Likewise, I am a professional liaison for the court in partnered efforts to craft effective criminal record expungement procedures that satisfy the requirements of the recently passed Prop 207 adult-use cannabis initiative in Arizona. 

My research has been published in [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [Sociological Inquiry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soin.12409), [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314), and [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2020.1845260), and is forthcoming in [Sociological Perspectives](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/spx).
