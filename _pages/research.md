My research takes an inductive approach that integrates computational and qualitative methods to explore the institutional dynamics of contested fields. I am particularly focused on analyzing semi-legal markets, organizations, and financial instruments to understand how the absence of important institutional conditions leads to concrete social outcomes. Additionally, I also maintain a research program devoted to using automated text analysis to understand various dimensions of political violence.

### Commercial Cannabis in The United States

I am particularly interested in understanding the social transformation of the cannabis market in the United States. As an industry that is currently criminalized at the Federal level, but is being propelled forward as a commercial enterprise by state laws, there is a unique opportunity to explore some of the more vexing questions that remain in institutional theory concerning how individual and organizational behavior is shaping field-level structure.

This dissertation project makes use of a number of original data sources. In the first phase of the project, I collected 56 in-depth interviews with cannabis professionals and regulators across California, Arizona, and Texas in order to understand how each of the three types of cannabis programs in the United States (e.g. Recreational, Medical, and Non-Psychoactive) organize commercial cannabis and shape consumer access.  These interviews offer insights into the contemporary challenges and expectations about the future of commercial cannabis in the United States. These insights are based on the types of business practices that independent and corporate cannabis companies used to navigate contradictory and conflicting regulations. In the second phase of the project, I collected a national survey of cannabis professionals that addressed whether the insights gathered from the interviews were patterns that emerged across the market or unique characteristics that revealed local responses to particular regulatory challenges. This survey was funded by the [National Science Foundation (Award: 1903986)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1903986&HistoricalAwards=false), and the [Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute](https://sbsri.sbs.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. 


Thus far, two working papers have emerged from this project. The first paper entitled "Sumptuary Administration and the Subnational Policy Domain for Commercial Cannabis in the United States" theorizes that despite federal precedent, commercial cannabis continues to expand because cannabis businesses strategically organize the labor process around reshaping state laws that are often inadequate, incomplete, or otherwise incapable of fully supporting the market. This mixed-methods article analyzes a custom dataset consisting of all state regulations configuring commercial cannabis in the United States and the interviews gathered in first phase of this project. Using the latent text analysis procedure Structural Topic Models (STM), I draw out prominent themes embedded in these regulations to make comparisons between collections of states (which in this context are considered subnational cannabis "regimes") that adhere to each of the three types of programs described above. These comparisons are used to develop expectations about how each competing vision of organizing the cannabis market will influence the practices of cannabis businesses. I then turn to the interviews as proximate cases of these regimes to evaluate these expectations and demonstrate that state governments are actually following the lead of cannabis businesses when crafting policies as opposed to setting the pace of the market. This paper is currently under review and available upon request.

The second paper entitled "Surveillance Regimes, Social Control, and Managing Semi-Legitimacy in the U.S. Commercial Cannabis Industry" theorizes commercial cannabis as "gray market" because it operates as a state-legal enterprise that stands in opposition to federal precedent. Given this assumption, this article draws on the interviews from the first phase of the project to explore how cannabis professionals manage their semi-legitimate status. Findings demonstrate that each state deploys a unique surveillance regime that is tethered to the specific regulatory agency (or agencies) responsible for enforcing commercial cannabis regulations. However, in addition to operating as core technologies of social control that structure commercial cannabis in meaningful ways, these surveillance regimes also operate as a type of heuristic for cannabis professionals to identify how to stay in compliance and manage semi-legitimacy through their business practices. This paper is currently under review and available upon request. 
 
### Automated Text Analysis and Political Violence

I maintain a parallel research program that utilizes automated text analysis to explore the causes and consequences of various dimensions of political violence. 

With colleagues Andrew P. Davis and Yongjun Zhang, I leveraged Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to demonstrate that despite sharing similar religious motivations, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) deploy different recruitment frameworks that focus on dissimilar goals. This finding challenges a common research practice of uncritically grouping terrorist organizations into the same niche based on abstract categories such as religion or region, and argues that by focusing on more fine grained characteristics such as goals, we gain a richer understanding of the motivations and outcomes of terrorist activity. Additionally, this article demonstrates the efficacy of topic modeling for comparative analysis in low-N studiesl This research has been published in [Poetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X17301456).


### Frameworks of Value Among Cryptocurrency Adopters

A previous line of research I pursued explored the boundaries between symbolic and non-symbolic value systems among adopters of cryptocurrencies. I began this project in 2015-2016 by collecting semi-structured interviews with early adopters of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin in order to understand how traditional economic value and symbolic values are tethered in an alternative money system that is not sanctioned by any government. I demonstrated how unique value schemas or "extra-institutional logics" emerged out of this community that supported Bitcoin during a market downturn despite being predicated on dissimilar visions about the future of the system. This research is published in [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314). Additionally, this project has revealed that embedding into alternative money systems follows a patterned and reflexive process. This research is forthcoming in [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/usfo20/current).
