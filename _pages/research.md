My research takes an inductive approach that integrates computational and qualitative methods to explore the institutional dynamics of contested fields. I focus on analyzing semi-legal markets, organizations, and financial instruments to understand how the absence of important institutional conditions leads to concrete social outcomes. Additionally, I also maintain a research program devoted to using automated text analysis to understand various dimensions of political violence.

### Commercial Cannabis in The United States

I am particularly interested in understanding the social transformation of the cannabis market in the United States. As an industry that is federally criminalized, but sanctioned as a commercial enterprise through state laws, there is a unique opportunity to explore some of the more vexing questions that remain in institutional theory concerning the ways that individual and organizational behavior shapes field-level structure.

My dissertation project makes use of a number of original data sources. In the first phase of the project, I collected 56 in-depth interviews with cannabis professionals and regulators across California, Arizona, and Texas in order to understand how each of the three types of cannabis programs in the United States (e.g. Recreational, Medical, and Non-Psychoactive) are organizing the commercial cannabis market. These interviews offer insights into the contemporary challenges facing cannabis professionals, and how these challenges are shaping the future of commercial cannabis in the United States. Largely, this data reveals the types of business practices that independent and corporate cannabis companies use to navigate contradictory regulations which situate them in a persistent state of semi-legality. In the second phase of the project, I surveyed cannabis professionals across the United States to understand whether the insights gathered from the interviews were patterned experiences that were indicative of broader market characteristics, or if they were localized responses that revealed some of the boundaries of the market. This survey was funded by the [National Science Foundation (Award: 1903986)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1903986&HistoricalAwards=false), and the [Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute](https://sbsri.sbs.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. 


Thus far, two working papers have emerged from this project. The first paper entitled "Sumptuary Administration and the Subnational Policy Domain for Commercial Cannabis in the United States" theorizes that despite federal precedent, commercial cannabis continues to expand because cannabis businesses are strategically organizing their labor practices  around reshaping state laws that are typically inadequate, incomplete, and/or incapable of fully supporting the market. This mixed-methods article analyzes a custom dataset consisting of all state regulations configuring commercial cannabis in the United States and the interviews gathered in first phase of this project. Using the latent text analysis procedure Structural Topic Models (STM), I draw out prominent themes embedded in these regulations to make comparisons between collections of states (which in this context are considered cannabis "regimes") that adhere to each of the three types of programs described above. These comparisons are used to distill the logics organizing commercial cannabis within each of these regimes. Next, I then turn to the interviews in order to evaluate how these logics translate into actual ways that cannabis businesses established absent market institutions in California, Arizona, and Texas as proximate cases of these regimes. The findings of this paper reveal that state governments actually follow the lead of cannabis businesses when crafting policies as opposed to setting the pace of the market. This paper is currently under review and available upon request.

The second paper entitled "Surveillance Regimes, Social Control, and Managing Semi-Legitimacy in the U.S. Commercial Cannabis Industry" theorizes that commercial cannabis is gray market because it operates as a state-legal enterprise that stands in opposition to federal precedent. With this assumption in mind, this article draws on the interviews from my dissertation to explore how cannabis professionals manage their semi-legitimate status. The findings in this paper demonstrate that California, Arizona, and Texas each deploy a unique surveillance regime that is tethered to the specific regulatory agency (or agencies) responsible for administering their state's commercial cannabis program. However, in addition to operating as core technologies of social control used to constrain the activities of cannabis businesses, these surveillance regimes also operate as a heuristic device that cannabis professionals leverage to identify how to stay in compliance and manage their professional semi-legitimacy. Typically, managing professional semi-legitimacy is carried out through the strategic use of business practices that meaningfully engage with surveillance in order to garner trust with the state. Consequently, the cannabis industry becomes an integral part of supporting, modifying, and at times, extending surveillance in practice. This paper is currently under review and available upon request. 
 
### Automated Text Analysis and Political Violence

I maintain a parallel research program that utilizes automated text analysis to explore the causes and consequences of various dimensions of political violence. 

With colleagues Andrew P. Davis and Yongjun Zhang, I leveraged Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to demonstrate that despite sharing similar religious motivations, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) deploy different recruitment frameworks that focus on dissimilar goals. This finding challenges a common research practice of uncritically grouping terrorist organizations into the same niche based on abstract categories such as religion or region, and argues that by focusing on more fine grained characteristics such as goals, we gain a richer understanding of the motivations and outcomes of terrorist activity. Additionally, this article demonstrates the efficacy of topic modeling for comparative analysis in low-N studies This research has been published in [Poetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X17301456).

### Frameworks of Value Among Cryptocurrency Adopters

A previous line of research I pursued explored the boundaries between symbolic and non-symbolic value systems among adopters of cryptocurrencies. I began this project in 2015-2016 by collecting semi-structured interviews with early adopters of the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin in order to understand how traditional economic value and symbolic values are tethered in an alternative money system that is not sanctioned by any government. I demonstrated how unique value schemas or "extra-institutional logics" emerged out of this community that supported Bitcoin during a market downturn despite being predicated on dissimilar visions about the future of the system. This research is published in [Social Currents](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2329496519880314). Additionally, this project has revealed that embedding into alternative money systems follows a patterned and reflexive process. This research is forthcoming in [Sociological Focus](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/usfo20/current).
