My core research program is primarily inductive and commonly integrates natural language processing and with more traditional qualitative methods to theorize the institutional dynamics of contested fields. There are three main components to this effort. First, I conduct case studies of gray markets to understand how unsettled legal structure shifts power arrangements between state and non-state actors, leads to the emergence of new technologies of social control, and influences the practices of stigmatized organizations. Second, I study companies that privately contract with prisons to provide products and services to understand the commercial exploitation of the incarcerated and the commodification of the prison experience. Finally, I analyze the logics of political violence to understand public support for state-sanctioned punishment in a cross-historical context.
