I take a learner-centered approach to teaching that incorporates cutting edge pedagogical tools to facilitate instruction. In addition to standard university courses, I also enjoy working with promising students to provide independent study research opportunities and mentorship. To date, I have been the instructor of record for online courses in Introduction to Sociology and Criminology. I have also been the instructor of record for in-person Independent Study courses for students interested in learning the research process. Course evaluations and syllabi are available upon request.


### Introduction to Sociology

As the foundation for training the sociologists of the future, I take particular enjoyment in facilitating this course. Introduction to Sociology is the first exposure to the study of group behavior and society that many students have. When available, I take great pride in teaching this course  due to how it impacted my own learning and trajectory as a student. I set a few clearly defined goals for students who take my intro course. First, students receive broad exposure to core topics in the field through a combination of primary texts, digital media, and instructor reading guides and lecture material. Second, I stress how these topics connect to contemporary events and push students to dig into these subjects through independent writing exercises that facilitate the development of critical thinking skills. Third, and arguably most importantly, I facilitate student-centered engagement that develops the sociological imagination by continually searching for ways to connect insights from the course to the life experience that students in the course bring with them into the classroom. This allows for each course to not only stay flexible, but also continually challenge me as an instructor to stay current with the needs of my students. Finally, given the vast resources available to structure this course I have had great success aggregating a core curriculum that makes use of open-source and non-paywall literature options to provide quality instruction without adding additional financial barriers to students.

### Criminology

It is important for social scientists to remain vigilent in providing robust criminological training to students in order to understand the backbone of policies, practices, and outcomes of the criminal justice system. Moreover, especially in light of current events, instructors of criminology share a unique mission to facilitate a critical lens among students so they are ready and able to apply core understandings about the social determinants of crime, in a way that facilitates more equitable policies and solutions in the future. This course achieves this mission through intensive theoretical engagement, coupled with a semester long policy-critique essay project that connects core concepts from the course to actual local and community issues. The main goal for this course is to have students gather a robust understanding of both the structural and cultural determinants of crime in order to better understand the criminal justice system as an institution of power. The policy critique project is intentionally designed for students to gain an in-depth understanding of a local criminal statute that affects their daily life, and explictly interrogate this policy in order to make an informed argument on how to revise it to increase equity and effectiveness. Through this exercise, students become more than just passive consumers of criminological theory, but active participants in shaping future social discourse on crime by being able to connect their understandings to community issues.

### Independent Study

Facilitating direct advising for student driven research is particularly rewarding for me as an instructor, because I enjoy working with promising students to develop their ability apply advanced methodological and writing skills that they will need to successfully transition into the next stage of their career. Moreover, it provides students with an opportunity to be exposed to the unveiled experience of being a practicing sociologist. Though not all students that I mentor continue on with a career in sociology, most find the skills that they acquire as interdisciplinary and transferable. I have had success advising both personal research projects and developing opportunities for students to leverage independent study courses to work on both NSF funded and internally funded research projects as a part of my research team.
