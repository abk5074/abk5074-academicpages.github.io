I take a learner-centered approach to teaching that incorporates cutting edge pedagogical technologies to facilitate instruction. In addition to university courses, I also enjoy working with promising students to provide independent study research opportunities and mentorship. Course evaluations and syllabi are available upon request.


### Introduction to Sociology

Truly the foundation of the discipline, this course is particularly enjoyable for me to administer due it's flexibility and importance. Introduction to Sociology is the first exposure that many students have to the study of group level social processes. I take great pride in teaching this course when available due to how it impacted my own learning and trajectory as a student. My goal for this course is to provide broad exposure to core topics in the field through contemporary events and push students to dig into these subjects through independent writing exercises that stress the development of critical thinking skills. Further, given the vast resources available to structure this course I have had great success aggregating a core curriculum that makes use of open-source and non-paywall literature options to provide quality instruction without adding additional financial barriers to students.

### Criminology

It is important for social scientists to remain vigilent in providing robust criminological training to students in order to understand the backbone of policies, practices, and outcomes of the criminal justice system. This course makes use of intensive theoretical exercises and semester capstone project aimed at developing a local-level policy critique. My goal for this course is to have students conceptualize crime as a both a structural and cultural process in order to understand the criminal justice system as an institution. The policy critique project is intentionally designed to interrogate policies affecting their immmediate lives to facilitate the connection between their coursework and direct community engagement.

### Independent Study

Facilitating direct advising for student driven research is particularly rewarding as an instructor because it provides promising students with the ability to develop advanced methodological and writing skills that are necessary for successfully transitioning into the next stage of their career. Moreover, it provides students with an opportunity to be exposed to the unveiled experience of being a practicing sociologist. Though not all students that I mentor continue on with a career in sociology, most find the skills that they acquire as interdisciplinary and transferable. I have had success advising both personal research projects and developing opportunities for students to leverage independent study courses to work on both NSF funded and internally funded research projects as a part of my research team.
