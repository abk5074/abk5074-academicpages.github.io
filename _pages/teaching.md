### The Integrative Social Sciences Research Lab (ISSRL)

The Integrative Social Sciences Research Lab (ISSRL) is a multi-locational research team. The aim is to connect exceptional undergraduate students with graduate students to conduct rigorous research studies under the supervision of faculty advisors. Originally launched while I was an undergraduate student, I now co-facilitate the ISSRL with faculty that are based at Penn State-Altoona. This lab produces award winning undergraduate research that is presented at national and regional conferences, professionalizes students by facilitating peer-reviewed publishing opportunities, and provides CV development support, statement of purpose workshops, and scholarly networking opportunities.
